            Beautiful gardens are at the heart of any community. 
            Willow Gardens' provide an entry point for individuals and households to get involved in the whole project. 
            Community gardeners use the land to grow their own food, which has a positive impact on their household food security. 
            We provide recreational outdoor activity as well as a fun and friendly environment for people of all ages, incomes, and cultures to work the land together and share their gardening knowledge and ideas. 
            Gardeners assist in site maintenance and management through volunteer commitments.
